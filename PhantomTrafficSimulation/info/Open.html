Most theoretical studies of taffic dynamics pertain to closed systems, 
i.e. ring roads. There simplicity appeals theoretical physicists.
Real freeways, however, are open systems. Remarkably, simulated
traffic breakdowns
in open systems lead to a different dynamics compared to
that in closed systems. 
The main differences are
<ul>
<li>One has to impose nontrivial boundary conditions at 
the inflowing and outflowing boundary. 
<li> The main control parameter is the traffic flow, in contrast to
the traffic density in closed systems
<li> 
Combining open systems with bottlenecks (which <i> always </i>
are present in reality!) leads to types of congested traffic 
that are not known from closed systems. For example,
breakdown from free to homogeneously flowing congested traffic
(<b> scenarios 3 and 4</b>), "triggered
stop-and go waves", or the coexistence of different congested states.
(to show these, one needs larger system than can be displayed here).
</ul>


The implementation of boundary conditions is tricky because
information can flow in both directions
<ul>
<li> downstream by the motion of each single vehicle
<li> upstream because stop-and-go waves and other collective 
motions travel against the driving direction
</ul>
To obtain a mathematically well-posed  problem and to avoid
overdetermination, the boundary conditions have to be dynamically
adapted during runtime.
