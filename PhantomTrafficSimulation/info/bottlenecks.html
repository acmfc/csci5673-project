Most traffic breakdowns on real freeways, i.e., in
<A href="./Open.html"> open systems, </A> are caused by bottlenecks.
A "bottleneck" is just a local decrease 
of the road capacity, for example

<ul>
<li> Onramps and intersections (<b> Onramp Scenario, </b>)
<li> lane closings (black region in the <b> Lane Closing Scenario, </b>) 
or narrowings at road works
<li> uphill or downhill gradients as in the <b> Uphill Grade Scenario Scenario,</b>
<li> and traffic lights as an example of
	  a time-dependent bottleneck.
</ul>
One can show that the macroscopic (i.e., large-scale) properties of
     traffic jam <i>propagation</i> are essentially determined by two factors
<ol>
<li> <b>Traffic demand</b>: Inflow and, if applicable, ramp flows,
<li> <b> bottleneck strength</b> indicating the severety of a
	  bottleneck, of whatever nature, with just a single number:
	  The reduction of the capacity (maximum throughput) compared
	  to that of the neighboring links.
</ol>
For the <i> generation </i> of traffic breakdowns and subsequent jams,
      a third "ingredient" comes into play: The <b> internal perturbation of
	the traffic flow</b>, e.g., by sudden braking or lane-changing
      maneuvers. This can be simulated by the

<A NAME = "SpeedLimits">
<h1>Simulating Speed Limits</h1>
</A>


By simulating the <b> Lane Closing Scenario</b>, we can demonstrate that imposing <i>sensible</i> speed
limits may indeed have <i> positive </i> effects. 
Speed limits are implemented by reducing the model parameter 
"desired velocity"
to the value of the speed limit.
Thus, chosing in Scenario 3 100% trucks is equivalent to imposing
a speed limit at the desired velocity of the trucks (80 km/h).

<ul>
<li>For 100% trucks (speed limit is active) 
at a flow rate of 1360 vehicles/hour, all vehicles manage to change lanes
before the location of the lane closing.
<li>
Now lift the speed limit and assume 20% trucks by changing the
percentage of incoming trucks from 100 to 20. Although the
static capacity 
(maximum equilibrium flow) of the new situation
is <i>much higher</i>, you will observe a traffic
breakdown at the lane closing!
</ul>
<p>
<i> "How can this be?" </i> 
<p>
Besides the decrease of the theoretical capacity,
there is a second effect
which dominates in most situations: <i> Homogenization </i>.
Because only fast drivers are affected, speed limits cut the
upper tail of the distribution of desired velocities
(Here: reduce the double peak distibution to a single delta peak
at 80 km/h). This
leads to more homogeneous traffic with less perturbations 
by abrupt braking manoeuvres. Because such perturbations trigger most
traffic breakdowns, the net effect of speed limits is beneficial.
<p>
<i> "Bad news for all the speeders ammong you!" </i>
<p>

However, for sufficiently low traffic flow, breakdowns cannot be
triggered even by arbitrarily strong perturbations. The simulations 
suggest that in this
case speed limits are not necessary.

<i> " At last there are some good news!" </i>
