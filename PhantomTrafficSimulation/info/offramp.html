This szenario demonstrates, how an off-ramp acts as a stationary
    bottleneck provoquing a traffic breakdown on the main road
    UPSTREAM of the on-ramp and
    FREE traffic downstream.
<br>
<ul>
<li>
With the initial settings with only a few percentages of diverging
    traffic, no jams are activated at the off-ramp. However, when
    increasing the diverge percentage on the off-ramp, the associated
    increased amount of lane changes and the ensuing perturbations
    eventually cause a breakdown even if, macroscopically, an off-ramp
    is a sort of "anti-bottleneck"! 

 <li>
 Play with the system and traffic demand settings (left column of
    sliders) and the driving style (right column) and look how various
    factors influence the lilelihood for traffic breakdowns at an
    off-ramp! 

</ul>
