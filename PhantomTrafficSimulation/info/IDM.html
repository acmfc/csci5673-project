In this simulation, we have used the 
<a href="http://xxx.uni-augsburg.de/abs/cond-mat/0002177">
Intelligent-Driver Model (IDM)</a> to simulate the longitudinal
    dynamics,
i.e., accelerations and braking
      decelerations of the drivers. 
<br><br>

<h3> Model Structure </h3>

<p> 
The IDM is an <i>microscopic</i> traffic flow model, i.e., 
each vehicle-driver combination constitutes an active "particle" in
the simulation. Such model characterize the traffic state at any
given time  by the positions and speeds of all simulated vehicles. In
case of multi-lane traffic, the lane index complements the state
description.

<p> More specifically, the IDM is a <i>car-following model</i>. In
  such models, the decision of any driver to accelerate or to
brake depends only on his or her own speed, and
on the position and speed of the "leading vehicle" immediately ahead.
Lane-changing decisions, however,  depend on all  neighboring
vehicles (see the lane-changing model <a href="./MOBIL.html">MOBIL</a>).

<p>The model structure of the IDM can be described as follows:
<ul class="red">
<li> The influencing factors (model input) are the own speed v, the
  bumper-to-bumper gap s to the leading vehicle, and the relative
  speed (speed difference) Delta v of the two vehicles (positive when approaching).
<li> The model output is the acceleration dv/dt chosen by the driver
  for this situation.
<li> The model <i> parameters</i> describe the driving style, i.e.,
  whether the simulated driver drives slow or fast, careful or
  reckless, and so on: They will be described in
  detail <a href="#IDMparameters">below.</a> 
</ul>

<h3> Model Equations </h3>

<p>The IDM model equations read as follows:
<center>
<p>
<img src = "./IDMv.png" height="70" align="center" 
                          alt = "IDM acceleration equation">
</center>
<p> 
where

<center>
<p>
<img src = "./IDMsstar.png" height="50" align="center" 
                   alt = "relation for desired distance">
</center>


<p>
The acceleration is divided into a "desired" acceleration 
a [1&#8722; (<sup>v</sup>/<sub>v<sub>0</sub></sub>)<sup>delta</sup>] on a free
road, and braking decelerations induced by the front vehicle.
The acceleration on a free road decreases from the initial
      acceleration a to zero when approaching the "desired speed"
      v0.
<br><br>
The braking term is based on a comparison between the "desired
      dynamical distance" s<sup>*</sup>, and the actual gap s to the
      preceding vehicle. If the actual gap is approximatively equal to
      s<sup>*</sup>, then the breaking deceleration essentially
      compensates the free acceleration part, so the resulting
      acceleration is nearly zero. This means, s<sup>*</sup>
      corresponds to the gap when following other vehicles in steadily
      flowing traffic. 
In addition, s<sup>*</sup> increases dynamically when
      approaching slower vehicles and decreases when the front vehicle
      is faster. As a consequence,
the imposed deceleration increases with
<ul class="red">
<li> decreasing distance to the front vehicle (one wants to maintain a
	certain "safety distance")
<li> increasing own speed (the safety distance increases)
<li> increasing speed difference to the front vehicle (when approaching
	the front vehicle at a too high rate, a dangerous situation 
        may occur).
</ul>

<p>The mathematical form of the IDM model equations is that of <i>
  coupled ordinary differential equations</i>:

<ul class="red">
<li> They are differential equations since, in one equation, the dynamic
  quantities v (speed) and its derivative dv/dt (acceleration) appear
  simultaneously.
<li> They are coupled since, besides the speed v, the equations also
  contain the speed v<sub>l</sub>=v&#8722; Delta v of the leading
  vehicle. Furthermore, the gap s obeys its own kinematic equation,
<br><br>
<center>
  ds/dt=&#8722; Delta v
</center>
<br><br>
 coupling the gap s to the speeds of the two vehicles.
</ul>




<a name = "IDMparameters"><h3> Model Parameters </h3> </a>

The IDM has intuitive parameters:
<ul class="red">
<li> desired speed when driving on a free road, v0
<li> desired safety time headway when following other vehicles, T
<li> acceleration in everyday traffic, a
<li> "comfortable" braking deceleration in everyday traffic, b
<li> minimum bumper-to-bumper distance to the front vehicle, s0
<li> acceleration exponent, delta.
</ul>

In general, every "driver-vehicle unit" can have its individual parameter
apply    set, e.g.,
<ul  class="red">
<li> trucks are characterized by low values of v0, a, and b,
<li> careful drivers drive at a high safety time headway T,
<li> aggressive ("pushy") drivers
are characterized by a low T in connection
	with high values
	of v0, a, and b.
</ul>
Often two different types are sufficient to show the main phenomena.
The standard parameters used in the simulations are the following:

<a name = "IDMsim"><h3> Simulation of the Model </h3> </a>

Simulation means to numerically "integrate", i.e., approximatively 
solve the coupled differential
equations of the model. For this, one defines a finite <i> numerical
  update time interval</i> &Delta;t, and integrates over this time
step assuming constant accelerations. This so-called <i> ballistic
  method</i> reads
<br><br>
<center>
<table border="0">
<tr><th style="text-align:left"> new speed:</th>
    <th style="text-align:left">
      <i> v(t+&Delta;t) = v(t) + (dv/dt) &Delta;t,</i></th>
</tr>
<tr><th style="text-align:left">new position:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</th>
    <th style="text-align:left">
      <i>x(t+&Delta;t) = x(t) + v(t)&Delta;t
         + 1/2 (dv/dt) (&Delta;t)<sup>2</sup>,</i></th>
</tr>
<tr><th style="text-align:left">new gap:</th>
    <th style="text-align:left"> 
      <i> s(t+&Delta;t)
           = x<sub>l</sub>(t+&Delta;t) &#8722; x(t+&Delta;t)&#8722;
            L<sub>l</sub>.</i></th>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
<br><br>
where dv/dt is the IDM acceleration calculated at time t,
x is the position of the front bumper, and L<sub>l</sub> the
length of the leading vehicle.
For the Intelligent-Driver Model, any update time steps below 0.5
seconds will essentially lead to the same result, i.e., sufficiently approximate
the true solution. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 
Strictly speaking, the model is only well defined if there is a
leading vehicle and no other object impeding the driving. However,
generalizations are straightforward:
<ul class="red">
<li> If there is no leading vehicle and no other obstructing object ("free
road"), just set the gap to a very large value such as
1000 m (The limes gap to infinity is well-defined for any meaningful
car-following model such as the IDM).
<li> If the next obstructing object is not a leading vehicle but a red
  traffic light or a stop-signalized intersection, just model the
  red light or the stop sign by a standing <i>virtual
  vehicle</i> of length zero positioned at the stopping line. When
  simulating a transition to a green light, just eliminate the virtual
  vehicle. (See the szenario "traffic Lights")
<li> If a speed limit (either directly by a sign or indirectly, e.g.,
  when crossing the city limits) becomes effective, reduce the desired
  speed, if the present value is above this limit (scenario
  "Laneclosing"). Likewise, reduce
  the desired speed of trucks in the presence of gradients (scenario
  "Uphill Grade")
</ul>


<a name = "IDMsimStop"><h3> Special Case of Stopped  Vehicles </h3> </a>

For vehicles approaching
an already stopped vehicle or a red traffic light, the ballistic
update method as described above will lead to negative 
speeds whenever the end of a time integration interval is not exactly
equal to the true stopping time (of course, there is always a mismatch).
Then, the ballistic method has to be generalized to
simulate following approximate dynamics:
<br><br> <i> If the true stopping
  time is within an update time interval, decelerate at constant
deceleration (dv/dt) to a complete stop and remain at standstill
until this interval has ended</i>.<br><br>

Furthermore, it may happen that the actual gap of a stopped vehicle <i> s</i> is slightly
  below the minimum gap <i> s<sub>0</sub></i>, in which case the
  unchanged IDM would give a negative acceleration, hence a negative
  velocity in the next time step. In most cases, however, real drivers
  will just keep that somewhat too low gap until the leader drives
  again rather than driving backwards. 

Both special cases can be implemented by following rules
which are generally applicable to integrating any time-continuous
car-following model, not just the IDM:

<br><br>
<center>
<table border="0">
<tr><td style="text-align:left">
      At least one of the above situations applies if:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td> 
    <td style="text-align:left">
      <i> v(t) + (dv/dt) &Delta;t &lt; 0,</i></td>
</tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:left">
     new speed in this case:</td>
    <td style="text-align:left">
     <i>  v(t+&Delta;t)=0,</i> </td>
</tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:left">new position in this case:</td>
   <td style="text-align:left">
   <i>  x(t+&Delta;t)=x(t) &#8722;  1/2 v<sup>2</sup>(t) /
   (dv/dt),</i></td>
</tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:left">new gap:</td>
   <td style="text-align:left">
     <i> s(t+&Delta;t)
    =x<sub>l</sub>(t+&Delta;t)&#8722; x(t+&Delta;t)&#8722; L<sub>l</sub>.</i></td></tr>
</table>
</center>
<br><br>
Notice that <i> &#8722; 1/2 v<sup>2</sup>(t) / (dv/dt)</i> is greater than
zero if the special cases apply.
