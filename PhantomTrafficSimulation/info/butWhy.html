Some reasons for developing traffic models are
<ul>

<li> To simulate the effect of control measures like
<ul>
<li> Speed limits
<li> Overtaking bans for trucks, especially at uphill or downhill sections
<li> Restrictions for lane changing, especially before or at merging
     regions
<li> Traffic flow control at on ramps
</ul>

<li> To simulate the effect of new infrastructure before
it has been build.

<li> To simulate the influence of vehicles with adaptive 
cruise-control systems. If an increasing precentage of vehicles has
such systems, does traffic become more stable? Can 
the traffic flow per lane be increased?
<li> Finally one can even simulate different or new traffic rules.
For example, allowing overtaking on freeways at either side combined
with a speed limit, ...
</ul>

In summary, traffic simulation can contribute to reduce traffic
    congestions <i> without </i> building new infrastructure!
